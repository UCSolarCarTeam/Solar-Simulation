= Steps to Setup Proper Camera Streaming Environment on a Fresh SD Card 

. Run MainInstaller.sh as root (found in the installer directory).
+
. Run AutobootSetup.sh as root (found in the installer directory).
+
. Run "tvservice -d edid" from the terminal followed by "edidparser edid".
+
. Find the preferred screen resolution / refresh rate from the list,
look for HDMI:EDID DMT or CEA mode.
+
. Open /boot/config.txt as root. Uncomment out hdmi_group and hdmi_mode.
   If the reolution was CEA, write a 1 for group, if it was DMT write 2
   Write the number in brackets after the mode for hdmi_mode.
+
i.e) if you see:
+
`HDMI:EDID best score mode is now DMT (27) 1280x800p @ 60 Hz with pixel clock 71 MHz (score 5184320)`
+
Then write 2 for hdmi_group and 27 for mode for a result of:
[source,shell]
# uncomment to force a specific HDMI mode (this will force VGA) 
hdmi_group=2 
hdmi_mode=27 
. Save the file and reboot the pi.
